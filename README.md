This is Cybin. This is an _*ALPHA*_ software. You've been warned.

##Goals:

* Real-time, from-scratch audio synthesis in LUA _(done)_
* Real-time, from-scratch video & image synthesis with LUA and OpenGL _(tbd)_
* Seamless transition from live performance to high-quality offline rendering _(tbd)_
* Loading audio, video, and image data _(tbd)_
* On-the-fly reloading of LUA/OpenGL code with file watchers or a REPL _(tbd)_
* C++ classes wrapped in LUA interfaces with efficient implementations of common effects and techinques _(tbd)_
  * _(granular synthesis, ray-marching, cellular automata, etc...)_
* Mind-blowing demos and example code _(tbd)_

##Dependencies
* LuaJIT
* LibSoundIO
