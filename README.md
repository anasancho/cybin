# Cybin

[![CYBIN_V0.0_DEMO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aEwmsLO0rBU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEwmsLO0rBU)

This is Cybin. This is early, unstable, _*alpha*_ software. You've been warned.

## Goals:

* Few dependencies (relatively speaking) _(done)_
* Real-time, from-scratch audio synthesis in LUA _(done)_
* Real-time, from-scratch video & image synthesis with LUA and OpenGL _(tbd)_
* Seamless transition from live performance to high-quality offline rendering _(tbd)_
* Loading audio, video, and image data _(tbd)_
* On-the-fly reloading of LUA/OpenGL code with file watchers or a REPL _(tbd)_
* C++ classes wrapped in LUA interfaces with efficient implementations of common effects and techinques _(tbd)_
  * granular synthesis
  * ray-marching
  * cellular automata
  * etc...
* Mind-blowing demos and example code _(tbd)_

## Dependencies
* LuaJIT
* LibSoundIO
